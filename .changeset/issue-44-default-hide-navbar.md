Default the deployed-app URL to `?hideNavBar=true` so every Code App built from this template hides the Power Apps "purple bar" by default. The wizard appends `hideNavBar=true` when capturing the deployed URL from `pac code push` output, the state API normalizes any pre-existing URL when surfacing it to the Summary page, and `.github/instructions/04-deployment.instructions.md` now promotes the flag from "checklist item" to "default appended". Closes #44.
