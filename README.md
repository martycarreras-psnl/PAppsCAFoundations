# Power Apps Code Apps — Foundations

A template repository with opinionated, comprehensive GitHub Copilot instruction files for building Power Apps Code Apps. Clone this repo (or use it as a template) to give every developer on your team consistent, AI-assisted guidance for scaffolding, connectors, components, deployment, testing, and security.

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/macarrer_microsoft/PAppsCAFoundations.git my-code-app
cd my-code-app
npm install
```

### 2. Set up authentication

**If using 1Password (recommended):**
- Ensure you have access to the team's shared 1Password vault
- Update `.env` with your vault/item/field names
- Run `npm run setup:auth`

**If using .env.local:**
- Copy `.env.template` to `.env.local`
- Fill in credentials from your team lead
- Run `npm run setup:auth`

### 3. Verify (no browser popup)

```bash
pac org who
```

### 4. Start building

See `00-environment-setup.instructions.md` for full setup details, then `01-scaffold.instructions.md` for project scaffolding.

## How It Works

When you open this project in VS Code with GitHub Copilot, the `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` files are automatically loaded. Copilot uses them to generate code that follows your team's exact standards — Fluent UI v9 components, TanStack Query hooks for connectors, solution-aware Dataverse patterns, and more.

Each file has an `applyTo` scope so Copilot only loads the relevant instructions based on which files you're editing.

## Using as a Template

1. Go to this repo's Settings → check "Template repository"
2. Every new Code App starts with "Use this template" on GitHub
3. Developers get the full instruction set from their first commit
